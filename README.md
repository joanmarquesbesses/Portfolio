🎮 Portfolio Game Mode

This is my interactive portfolio — entirely programmed from scratch.
In addition to browsing the sections normally, you can activate Game Mode and explore it as a mini-platformer!

🕹️ Controls

A / D → Move left and right

Space → Jump

Walk to the screen edges → Travel between sections

Try to collect the three coins hidden throughout the portfolio...
Once you reach the Contact section with all of them — you’ll unlock a special surprise! ✨
